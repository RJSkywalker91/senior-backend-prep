# senior-backend-prep
Structured roadmap of projects and study to transition into Senior Backend Engineering, with a focus on networking, distributed systems, and real-time backends.
This repo serves as both a **portfolio** and a **learning log**, showcasing practical work across networking, APIs, microservices, distributed systems, and real-time backends.

---

## Purpose
- Demonstrate a deliberate, step-by-step path into backend engineering.
- Showcase projects that mirror real industry scenarios (scalable APIs, real-time services, cloud deployments).
- Build a portfolio that highlights not just code, but **design thinking, documentation, and trade-off decisions**.

---

## Structure
This repository is organized by topic, following a 6-month transition plan:

1. **Networking Basics**
   - TCP/UDP echo servers (Python & C#)
   - Asynchronous socket chat server
   - Notes on TCP vs UDP tradeoffs
2. **Backend Foundations**
   - REST API with database + JWT authentication
   - CRUD operations, error handling
   - Dockerized local deployment
3. **Distributed Systems**
   - Microservices split from API
   - Message queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka/SQS)
   - Redis caching layer
4. **Cloud & DevOps**
   - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
   - Deployment to AWS / Azure
   - Monitoring + structured logging
5. **Real-Time Systems**
   - WebSocket multiplayer lobby
   - Matchmaking logic + state management
   - Load testing (50–100 simulated players)
6. **Advanced Topics**
   - CAP theorem + consistency models
   - Event sourcing & CQRS
   - Reliability patterns (retry, backoff, circuit breaker)

---

## Checkpoints
Each phase ends with a checkpoint:
- Clear explanation of core concepts
- Working code with documentation
- Reflection on trade-offs and lessons learned

---

## Notes
This repo is both **portfolio** and **study log**:  
- Code quality will evolve alongside understanding.  
- Documentation will include architecture diagrams, retrospectives, and design trade-offs.  
- Each project highlights a specific **backend engineering competency**.

## 📌 About Me
I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with professional experience designing APIs, building integrations, and collaborating across teams to deliver scalable solutions. Over the years, I’ve worked with **C#, Python, JavaScript, .NET, React, SQL, and AWS**, always gravitating toward backend challenges — from pioneering new REST APIs to refactoring legacy systems for performance and security.

I’m methodical in my approach: I enjoy breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, and I thrive on finding elegant solutions that balance **technical design, reliability, and user needs**. I’m also passionate about continuous improvement — whether that’s refining a messy codebase, streamlining CI/CD pipelines, or exploring new patterns in distributed systems.

Outside of code, I bring creativity and energy from my hobbies. I’m an avid gamer and Dungeons & Dragons storyteller, and I love connecting technical problem-solving with creative thinking. My goal is to channel that same energy into backend engineering roles, especially in **gaming, real-time systems, and distributed architectures**, where performance and scalability really matter.
