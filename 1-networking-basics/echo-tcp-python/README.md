## 📌 Overview
What is it?
- A simple TCP echo server that accepts client connections and sends back messages.
Why did I build it?
- Exploring the basics again after almost 10 years

## 📖 Notes & Reflections
What went well?
- Easy implementation
- Fun to learn the low-level things
What was challenging?

What you’d improve if you revisited this?
- Add error handling
