# TCP Echo Server in Go

## 📌 Overview
What is it?
- A simple TCP echo server that accepts client connections and sends back messages.
Why did I build it?
- Pushing my boundaries by building something relatively easy with a new programming language.

## 📖 Notes & Reflections
What went well?
- Intuitive socket library
- Not a hard language to pick up
What was challenging?
- Not certain what the normal go "conventions" are for programming. Lots to learn still.
What you’d improve if you revisited this?
- N/A

## Workflows
- TBD
