# Project Title (e.g., TCP Echo Server in Python)

## 📌 Overview
A short description of the project:
- What it does (e.g., "A simple TCP echo server that accepts client connections and sends back messages.")
- Why you built it (e.g., "Part of my backend engineering transition, exploring TCP fundamentals.")

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- [ ] Core backend concept this project demonstrates
- [ ] Specific skills/libraries used
- [ ] Trade-offs or design considerations

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python / C#
- Libraries/Frameworks: asyncio, .NET Sockets, etc.
- Tools: Docker, etc. (if applicable)

## 🚀 How to Run
**Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RJSkywalker91/senior-backend-prep.git
cd directory/project/file
```
**Run the Server**
```bash
python src/server.py
```
**Test with Client**
```bash
curl localhost
```

## 📖 Notes & Reflections
- What went well (e.g., "First time using async sockets in Python, got multiple clients working smoothly.")
- What was challenging (e.g., "Handling disconnects gracefully took some research.")
- What you’d improve if you revisited this.
