# Backend Foundations Notes

I want to create a very simple Matchmaking Ticket REST API to explore:
- REST architecture
- JWT Authentication
- Database connection
- CRUD operations
- Simple, idempotent workflow
- All of the above using GO

# Vertical Slice Player API
The goal will be to build out a complete api with database connection (PostgreSQL). This will be E2E from router, handler, service, and repository levels.
